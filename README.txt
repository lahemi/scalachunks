A collection of small scala programs, yet without their own repository.


Proforma

    A web server in the making, has got them GET and POST implemented
    for forms. Uses mariadb as a database, via slick.
    Hence the jars for slick, mysql and slf4j.
    INSERTing and SELECTing those stored things are pretty much
    the functionality. Those are, in fact, the core functionality
    I had in mind when I started making this. Everything else
    will be for giggles. There are no styles or anything like that atm.
    
    Scala 2.11.2 were used.
